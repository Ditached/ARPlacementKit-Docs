## Why AR Foundation 5.0+?

We decided to only support AR Foundation 5.0 because it is the latest version. There are major changes between versions and it is difficult to support more than one.
Version 5.0+ provides support for testing within the Editor, which is essential to ensure uninterrupted development.
