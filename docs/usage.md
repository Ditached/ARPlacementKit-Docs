# Usage
## Scanning the environment
When prompted by the coaching overlay (iOS only), move the device slowly, looking at surfaces from different angles.
After a few seconds, detected surfaces should be marked with a grid of blue circles.

## Initial placement
To spawn the object, tap on a detected surface (marked with blue circles).

## Transforming the object
### Movement
To move the object, tap and drag. If you keep your finger on the object, you can either move the object with one finger or move the entire mobile device.

### Rotation
Rotate the object by touching the screen with two fingers and rotating them around each other.

### Scale
Scale the object by touching the screen with two fingers and moving them apart to make the object bigger or closer together to make it smaller (pinch gesture).

### Fine Tuning
To open the fine-tuning interface, tap the angle/scale display. To hide it, tap anywhere else on the screen.
