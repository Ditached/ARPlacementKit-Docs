How do I install this package
=================

If you have trouble installing the package, you can check out `this guide from Unity <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-import.html>`_.

Stuff is pink
=================
When objects are rendered pink, you are probably not using the URP (Universal Render Pipeline). Starting the a new project with the 3D (URP) starting template will prevent this problem. But it is also possible to upgrade.
For more information `check out this guide <https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@15.0/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html>`_.
