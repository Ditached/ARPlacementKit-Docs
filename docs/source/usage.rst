Getting Started
===============

**It is recommended to start with a new project. The best option is to use the 3D (URP) starting template provided by Unity when starting a new project.**

In order for the package to work, there a few important requirements:

    - Your project needs to use URP (Universal Render Pipeline)
    - No version of AR Foundation below 5.0 is installed (When no version is installed, the package will do it)
    - You are using Unity 2021.2 or higher


When first installing the package from the package manager it might warn you that the new input system is used. Press *YES* to restart the editor.

After the editor has restarted, you can start using the package. If at this point there are any error related to the package, make sure to check it out the troubleshooting section. Again, a new project is the best way to make sure no conflicts with other packages are the problem.
